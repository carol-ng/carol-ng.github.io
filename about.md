# Hello!

I'm Carol, a third-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, pursuing a Minor in Honours Mathematics, as well as a variety of physics and computer science courses. I've interned at [Shopline HK](https://www.shopline.hk) as a software developer in the winter of 2016, and I currently work with a few groups at UBC:

* [UBC Faculty of Applied Science](), as a PASS leader
* [UBC Physics and Astronomy](), as a first-year engineering lab teaching assistant
* [UBC Learning Commons](), as a project coordinator for the web team

I'm currently working on improving a [2D shooter](https://www.github.com/carolkng/danmakube) for Android, finding a better way to [log my meals]({% post_url 2017-01-15-building-a-native-android-app%}), and creating [a chatbot](https://www.github.com/carolkng/talk-to-me) that I hope will eventually be able to take over all of my social communications. 

In my spare time, when I'm not busy churning out problem sets, working on education-related projects, or studying for my midterms, you can probably find me devouring books on my phone, converting caffeine into code, or napping on a long bus ride.

In previous years, I've also designed some things for various university groups, which you can view on [cargocollective](https://cargocollective.com/carolkng) in the meantime, while I work on migrating my portfolio over to this new Jekyll site.

If I've said anything interesting or you're just looking for someone to talk to, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@carolkng.com). I try hard to be a good conversation buddy, and I'm always willing to listen if you have something to say.
