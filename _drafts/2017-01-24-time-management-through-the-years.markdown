- Crunch week through the years
- As the work gets harder, I guess you can work smarter

As an overzealous student in Engineering Physics, I've always had a fun time trying to fit things in my schedule. In my second year, also known as the year I realized that first year Science did NOT prepare me for the absolute terror that is thr second year engineering workload, I was taking 6 courses, which was pretty much the bare minimum of courses anyone in ny program would be taking, if they wanted to graduate on time. As a na√Øve young student, I thought that I could handle 3 separate, heavy-duty extracurriculars, each averaging an additional 100-150 hours per term. Several of my classmates were doing the same thing. However, compared to me, they were much better-prepared for the second year avalanche, not to mention that all of them were extraordinary students. 

I, on the other hand, was a yet inexperienced baby engineer who had severely overestimated her time management abilities and had bitten off way more than she coukd chew.

So I did whatever any overzealous, inexperienced student would do: I forged ahead, without regard for my grades or my health, mental or physical. With the mindset that I would take on any challenge presented to me, no matter the cost, I made a bunch of decisions that have fundamentally changed the way I work, for better or for worse. Here were some of the consequences:

- I pulled more all-nighters in an average month that term than I had ever pulled in my life.
- I nearly failed a course for the first time (we're talking REALLY close to failure here).
- Most importantly, by the end of the term, I lost any lingering sense of self-respect that I may have had going into the year. I was trash, and I knew it. Had I not been able to secure a co-op job for the following term, I think I might have dropped out of school entirely. The stress was 

Last term, when I decided to tackle 7 courses (one of which was Real Variables I, aka the hardest math course I have ever taken, given the proof-light ciurses that I was used to taking), I was able to learn from my mistakes in second year, and I made a promise to myself to drop all of my extracurriculars in order to focus on my school work.

Of course, as we all know, this did not pan out as I had expected. Without feeling some kind of urgent time pressure 24/7, I was constantly taking long bouts of unproductive "rest"
