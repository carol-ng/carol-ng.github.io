Status update: Not 24 hours after my initial post on my switch to a liquid diet, I have already eaten 5 mini ham and cheese sandwiches, 2 mini spinach and cheese quiches, as well as some gluten free sandwiches. Any "dieter" worth their salt would say that this was a huge failure. 

I am a terrible dieter. üçî üëç

To me, the opportunity to interact with a ton of industry professionals is too important for me to tackle on an empty stomach. Now that I have some business cards, invaluable company insights, and a steam key for an older version of Dawn of War (thanks, Relic!), I'm confident that I made the right choice.

## Part 3: Implementing UI elements

## Part 4: Coding it up

Next post will probably focus on additional polish and monetization (which I don't plan to forcibly implement in the near future). Since I'm kind of overloaded with co-op applications and coursework at the moment, this project will probably be a bit slow to update, sorry!
