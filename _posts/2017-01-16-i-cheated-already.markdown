Status update: Not 24 hours after my initial post on my switch to a liquid diet, I have already eaten 5 mini ham and cheese sandwiches, 2 mini spinach and cheese quiches, as well as some gluten free sandwiches. Any "dieter" worth their salt would say that this was a huge failure. 

I am a terrible dieter. üçî üëç

To me, the opportunity to interact with a ton of industry professionals is too important for me to tackle on an empty stomach. Now that I have some business cards, invaluable company insights, and a steam key for an older version of Dawn of War (thanks, Relic!), I'm confident that I made the right choice.

## Part 3: Implementing UI elements

I'm currently using [wireframes.cc](http://www.wireframes.cc) to create clean mockups of the UI. Using the classic screen size of !!! * !!! for a large majority of the most popular Androids, I've been modtly dragging and dropping their predefined UI elements haphazardly into the screens.

When you're finished, your mockup will have gone from this:

to this!

So much cleaner! In a similar fashion to Wire Floe for Android, which I used to create the most basic layout on my phone, wireframes.cc also lets you create interactive prototypes to replicate the user experience for your app. The main difference is that the animations and transitions are much more true to the final product that you'll be coding up later on, which will prove to be immensely useful in the coding stage.

Next post will probably focus on actually coding it up, but I also have plans to expand the series to include additional polish and monetization (which I don't plan to forcibly implement in the near future). Since I'm kind of overloaded with co-op applications and coursework at the moment, this project will probably be a bit slow to update, sorry!
