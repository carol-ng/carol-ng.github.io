description: Wordpress, it's been nice knowing you.

After ~3 years (who's counting?) of reading blogs and making my own half-baked projects, I've finally started documenting my own projects as well. For context, here's a brief list of my early attempts at blogging:

1. Signed up for my first Blogger site, and wrote one 50-word post. Forgotten as quickly as it was created. (2013/2014?)
2. Created a new, mostly anonymous Wordpress site, and started writing about really personal stuff. Deleted out of shame, since I didn't turn off search engine indexing when it was first created. (November 2015)
3. Thought about making my own Python-based CMS, just for fun, completely from scratch. Created about 50% of a "new" markup language based on Markdown with less forgiving syntax before I got owned by the second wave of midterms. (October 2016) 
4. Spent a good 4 hours at YVR airport trying to create the "perfect" portfolio landing page with smooth JS-free animations and custom SVGs. Decided that design-heavy initial commitments were probably not the right way to go. (2 days ago)

If I've learned anything, I'm much more wary of sharing/designing/anything in excess. This blog will mostly be a catalog of my project progression, with a sprinkling of reflections on my journey as a student. I hope the content on this blog actually ends up helping someone, in the same way so many great blogs have done before me.

Finally, I look forward to doing some tricky things with Jekyll and getting comfy with all its nifty features! To get some initial  momentum going, I'm going to try and publish a blog post every day of the winter break (until January 2nd). Should I fail to meet my goal, gentle, public mocking is allowed and encouraged.
