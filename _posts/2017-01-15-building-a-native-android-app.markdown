## Step 1: Find your purpose

My schedule looks quite hectic on the week of the 23rd. In addition to the 5 assignments I have due (not including labs), my work as a [PASS leader]() is beginning to pick up, and the first midterms are just around the corner. During the robot competition last summer, I saw more and more of my class mates adopting liquid-based meals (read: Soylent) as the work kept piling on. In the name of science, time management, and finally getting my priorities together, I've decided to abandon the world of solid food for a week, completely ignore any regard for nutrition, and commit to reporting back with an impression of how the experiment.

Here's my daily menu:
 * Liquid whipping cream: 1/2 cup
 * Orange pekoe tea/black coffee: 1/4 cup (to water down the cream and add some flavour)
 * Butter: 2 teaspoons (for the salt!)

Initial expenditure: $5.99 for 1L of whipping cream, $2 for 60 bags of tea, and $3.99 for 2 cups (96 teaspoons!) of butter

Daily cost of food: ~ 87 cents! Not bad.

I wanted to create an Android app for my to check off the list of food I was consuming throughout the day, just so I had an **overview of how much more food I could eat, and to shame myself productively if I ever went overboard**.

## Step 2: Look & Feel

If you've read the "[almost tutorial]({% post_url 2016-12-24-hello-libgdx %}
)" that I wrote on creating a small game in libGDX, you'll notice that I've started off with design in this space, instead of programming the logic right away. In the case of this utilitarian Android app, I've opted to go for wireframing and storyboarding first, since I felt the user experience would be critical to user adoption. For now, I won't be running any user experience tests, since I myself am currently the target market for this app, but it is worth doing if you're building an app for a certain large cohort of users.

Since I'm a little obsessed with working on my phone (that Galaxy Note 3 hasn't exploded on me... yet?), I did the majority of my wireframing on my phoneusing the [Wire Flow]() app for Android. Although the snap to grid function was pretty irritating at first, I think it's important for keeping things simple, and forcing you to look at the overall experience, versus tiny details like the "ideal" alignment.

Here are some initial wireframes made in the app:

`!!! insert wireframes from the app`

A feature that isn't heavily advertised in the app (but definitely should be) is the ability to create and demo **LIVE PREVIEWS** from within the app. It's one thing to make your wireframes look intelligible - it's another to make sure all of your designs flow meaningfully from one to another.

That's it for now - stay tuned for the next part (with upgraded designs and 100% more code)! You can also look out for more updates on my liquid diet adventures, and possible confessions, if I ever "accidentally" stuff 5 tiny sandwiches down my throat out of grief.

**Update:** [Just 24 hours after this post: a food-related confession.]({% post_url 2017-01-16-i-cheated-already %})
